# The Beyond
Small space-themed arcade game project (incomplete)
## Description
Simple arcadey asteroids survival game. I made this project summer of 2020 during the pandemic as something to keep me occupied. I didn't really have much experience with XNA Game Studio at this point since I had just completed my high school Video Game Development class. There is a lot of unfinished things about this game as I couldn't pick just one game to work on. This game me a good idea into creating sprites, object-oriented programming, and working with game states.
